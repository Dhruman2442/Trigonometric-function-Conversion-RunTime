Project Name: Web Search Engine for Content Retrieval and Keyword Ranking

Description:
I am excited to present my latest project, a web search engine designed to efficiently find and retrieve HTML pages, parse their content, and provide users with keyword-based search results. This project combines web crawling, text extraction, and keyword ranking to deliver accurate and user-friendly search experiences.

Key Features:
🌐 Web Crawling: My web search engine scans the internet for HTML pages, indexing them for future retrieval.

📃 HTML to Text Conversion: The engine parses HTML content and converts it into text files, making the data accessible and ready for keyword search.

🔍 Keyword Search: Users can enter keywords of interest, and the engine searches through the saved text files to find relevant pages.

📊 Ranking Algorithm: Pages containing the entered keywords are ranked based on relevance, ensuring that the most valuable results appear at the top of the list.

🔗 Linking to Original Content: Users can easily access the original HTML page from the search results to view the content in its original format.

🚀 Performance Optimization: The search engine is designed for speed and efficiency, delivering results quickly and accurately.

Why This Project?
The motivation behind this project was to create a web search tool that not only finds web content but also converts it into a format that's easy to navigate and search through. By focusing on keyword ranking and providing suggestions for similar words, my goal was to enhance the user's search experience and ensure they find the information they need, even if their query isn't perfect.

Demonstration:
I invite you to try out my web search engine and experience its capabilities firsthand. Whether you're researching topics, seeking specific information, or just curious about web content, this tool can help streamline your search process.

Future Enhancements:
I am continually working to improve this project. Future enhancements may include real-time indexing, advanced ranking algorithms, and more intuitive user interfaces.
